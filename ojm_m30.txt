M30 -- ogg "xor'ed" encrypt, samples are decrpyted by xor'ing 4bytes a time with 'nami' <6E 61 6D 69>

the M30 has a header of 28 bytes:

struct M30_header {
	char signature[4]; // M30\0
	char unk_fixed[8];
	short sample_count;
	char unk_fixed2[6];
	int payload_size;
	int unk_zero;
};

after that we have the samples data.
each sample starts with a header of 52 bytes.

struct M30_sample_header {
	char sample_name[32];
	int sample_size;
	char unk_1[8];
	int reference;
	int unk_2;
}

after the header, there is ogg data, xor'ed with 'nami'.

after that we got the next sample header, same as above..


 -missing
- the reference doen't quite match the ojn
