- add note effects

- add combo counter

- add support to the volume and pan of the OJN

- capture keyboard pressed keys

- workaround ranks in bms

- branch implement JOGL - see if it's worth the trouble

- rescale textures if the resolution isn't 800x600

- test the BPM modifier

- make a ChartWriter

- add MP3 support (javazoom's javalayer probably) -- is this really needed ?
