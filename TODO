- create a config screen to the interface

- make the score & ranking system

- fix the long note flare animation

- finish the bms implementation
	- add support to choose different key number
	- test LNOBJ

- branch implement JOGL - see if it's worth the trouble

- rescale textures if the resolution isn't 800x600

- make a ChartWriter

- add MP3 support (javazoom's javalayer probably) -- is this really needed ?
