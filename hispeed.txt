.5x   -   480  -   192    800x600 -- original
.5x   -   500  -   200    800x625 -- resized

 1x   -   480  -   384    800x600 -- original
 1x   -   500  -   400    800x625 -- resized

80%


the measure bar actually is 3 pixel height, but only the center is considered the measure point,
on 1x speed the measure is 384 pixel height(on a 800x600 resolution=> only 480 pixel are usable)

600 screen -- 480 usable space ( 80%)
480 usable space -- 384 measure size ( 80%)

So far we know how the notes are displayed inside the measure but now how the measures are displayed
inside as a whole, the notes position inside the measure is independent from the hispeed, all the hispeed
does is changing the measure size( the height actually).
On o2jam the native resolution is 800x600 but not all of those 600 pixels are used, I found that the exact
space used for the notes falling is 480 pixels and, at 1x hispeed, the measure is 384 pixels,
the multipliers are direct aplied at 384 so at 3x hispeed the measure is 1152 = 384*3.

We could stop here already, but today I don't think 800x600 is good enough anymore, but we can't just make
the screen bigger, that would make the view space bigger thus given an advantage of some sort.

So to maintain the scale of the game at any resolution, I made some simple math :

480/600 = 0.8, so the usable space is 80% of the screen size !, and..
384/480 = 0.8, coincidence or not, the measure at 1x is also 80%, but of the usable space.

Following this we can scale the screen up any resolution, 
example with 1024x768:

768 * 0.8 = 614(.4 but truncated/rounded) pixels of usable space.

0.5x -> 614 * 0.4 = 245(.6) pixels of measure size.
1x   -> 614 * 0.8 = 491(.1)  idem
2x   -> 614 * 1.6 = 982(.4)  idem
... and so on.
