a bms ( actually bme file which is the "extended" syntax, but I will just say bms for simplicity), 
file have basically 2 types of lines, command lines #<word> <something> and data lines #<numbers> <numbers>

the commands can contain metadata, or directions on how to interpret the data.

values types:
<integer> - a whole number
<string> - any sequence of characters
<real> - a real number
<XX> - 2 characters ranging from 00 to ZZ
<hex> - hexadecimal number, range from 00 to FF

commands:

#PLAYER <integer>
	this number refers to the type of chart:
	1: single player
	2: 2 players
	3: double play( 14 keys)
	4: ????

#GENRE <string>
	the genre of the song in string

#TITLE <string>
	the title in string

#ARTIST <string>
	the artist in string

#BPM <integer> OR #BPM<XX> <real>
	the integer version indicates starting bpm for the song
	the real version is assigned to the XX code, used on channel 8.

#MIDFILE <string>
	a midi file to auto-play

#PLAYLEVEL <integer>
	the level of the song

#RANK <integer>
	the difficult level
	0: very hard
	1: hard
	2: normal
	3: easy

#VOLWAV <integer>
	volume of sound playing in percentage ( ??? )

#WAV<XX> <string>
	the string refers to a sound file to be assigned to the XX code
	the XX code can then be used in the channels to refer to the sound file

#BMP<XX> <string>
	refers to a image file, assigned to the XX code, will be displayed
	when the notes are played over it. channels 4, 6, 7 (????)

#STAGEFILE <string>
	an image to be displayed before the song starts

#VIDEOFILE <string>
	a video file to be played during the song (?????)

#STOP<XX> <integer>
	stop time( a rest ?), the integer is relative to the measure, <integer>/192 * measure_size ( ??? ) 
	
#LNTYPE <integer>
	defines which type of long notes to use, there are 2 types ( can be used simultaneous ????)
	both types use channels 5x and 6x instead of normal note channels
	1: one XX code to defined long note start, followed by 00, and a XX code to define an end
	2: the XX code that defines the start is repeated as necessary, e.g: AAAAAAAAAAAABBB..

#LNOBJ <XX>
	another way to use long notes, ( how this works ????)

#EXTCHR ???????????????


------------------------------------------

channels:
1: auto-play sample
	samples here are always played when reach judgment

2: time signature of measure
	specify a fractional measure with a <real>
	e.g.: #00302:0.5 -- the measure 3 will be half the normal measure size

3: BPM change
	this specify the bpm on the measure in <hex>

4: BGA

5: ????

6: Poor/Miss BGA

7: BGA layer

8: extended BPM
	used in the same way as channel 3 but refers to a <real>
	assigned on the #BPM command

9: stop something.. (what ?)

10: ????

11,12,13,14,15,18,19: note keys
	the note keys, <XX> codes indicate a note and at the same time
	a specify a sound to play, defined in the #WAV command

16: scratch ( not used on o2jam )

17: ????

20: ????

21,22,23,24,25,28,29: player 2 note keys ( not used on o2jam )
	same as channels 11~19 but for #PLAYER 2

26: player 2 scratch ( not used on o2jam )

27: ????

5x: long notes (LNTYPE) notes for player 1
	same as channels 11~19

6x: long notes (LNTYPE) notes for player 2 ( not used on o2jam )
	same as channels 21~29
