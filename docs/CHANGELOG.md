Alpha 7
=======

After more than a year, this release brings in a lot of new features:

* Sound system changed from OpenAL to FMOD Ex. There should be less audio issue in this release.
* Better support for BMS, OJM and OJN, and SM parsers.
* Partial support for background animations in BMS files.
* Audio and display latency settings and syncing.
* More accurate calculation of health points, based on the selected difficulty.
* Regul-Speed modifier which makes all notes scroll at same speed, regardless of BPM changes (borrowed from beatmaniaIIDX).
* Local matching. Play open2jam with your friends.
* Lot of bug fixes.
