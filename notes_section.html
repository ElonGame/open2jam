<h2>Notes Section</h2>

<p>Before diving into the notes section is important to define some terms:</p>

<p><strong>events</strong>: The notes section doesn't just contain the notes, it also has the bpm changes of the music (and other things that I got yet to found out), 
so I will just call them events.</p>

<p><strong>beat</strong>: Ever noticed those horizontal lines in between the notes during the music ? Those are the beats, and for all the notes before the first line we 
call them beat 0, after the first we call them beat 1 and so on.</p>

<p><strong>package</strong>: These are the blocks that form a note section, each package contain one or more events inside. 
Each package correspond to a specifically beat in a speciffically channel( see below).
The number of packages in each section is in the package_count variable in the header section.</p>
<br>
Each package has a mini header as follows:
<pre>struct package_header {
	 long32 beat;
	short16 channel;
	short16 events;
};</pre>

<p><strong>beat:</strong> This is the beat in which the package will appear.</p>
<p><strong>channel</strong>: This determine the package type, so far a got these:
<table><tr><th>channel</th><th>type</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>BPM change</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>note on 1st lane</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>note on 2nd lane</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>note on 3rd lane</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>note on 4th lane(middle button)</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>note on 5th lane</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>note on 6th lane</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>note on 7th lane</td></tr>
</table>
looks like this values goes up to 21, but I don't know the meaning of these.
</p>

<p><strong>events</strong>: The number of events inside the package.</p>
<br>

Each event has, as far as I know, 4 bytes, when the channel is 1(BPM change) these 4 bytes are a float with the new BPM.
When the channel is a between 2..8(note), these 4 bytes are divided like this:
<pre>struct note_event {
	short value;
	char unk;
	char note_type;
};</pre>
<p><strong>value</strong>: when value is 0 the event is ignored ( see below why), otherwise I am guessing its the OJM sample reference.</p>
<p><strong>unk</strong>: It's usually 0, on V3 is has some values, but none on Red Sign, I'm clueless.</p>
<p><strong>note_type</strong>: 0 when it's is a normal note, 2 when it is the start of a long note, and 3 at the end of a long note.</p>
<br>

<p>As you could see, each package can have more than one event, in these cases, the position of the event inside the beat is determined dividing the ocurrence by the
number of events. Example: if you got a package with 16 events, the 8th event will be at the middle of the beat(8/16=0.5), that's probably why we have those 
'ignored events'(value = 0), they are there for padding the real events in the right position inside the beat.</p>

<br><br>

Well that's pretty much all, I still got to find out how the speed affect the notes position, but I'm almost sure it simple changes the beat size, 
and the beat size is probably scaled by the screen size.
